# Co-authorship-network-link-prediction
Pairwise relationships are prevalent in real life, and these relationships can be represented as links or edges in a network. In this project, the application of link prediction in the context of academic co-authorship is examined. The algorithms and models seek to learn from existing nodes and links in the network in order to predict the existence of potential future links by drawing upon various machine learning techniques.
